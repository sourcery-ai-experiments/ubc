SiEPIC Ebeam PDK adapted from [siepic Ebeam PDK](https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK) for gdsfactory.
It provides a fully python driven flow alternative for the most advanced users taking the [edx course](https://www.edx.org/course/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-and-data-ana)

## Installation

### Installation for users

Use python3.10 or python3.11. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE.

If you don't have python installed on your system you can [download anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

Once you have python installed, open Anaconda Prompt as Administrator and then install the latest gdsfactory using pip.

pip install ubcpdk --upgrade
```

Then you need to restart Klayout to make sure the new technology installed appears.
